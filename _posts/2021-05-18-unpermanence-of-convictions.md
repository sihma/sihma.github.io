There is [this quote](https://genius.com/19500237) in a R.A.P. Ferreira's song that, as said on Genius, comes from the _Hagakure,_ the so-known "samurai bible". In short: "pure will in every moment". But what that mean? And also, what can it mean to me?

As far as I know, it sounds quite simple because I have yet to experiment it.

I believe willingness relies heavily on meaning. We, psychologically, have willingness to act, because it has a meaning towards something we want. This is something deeply entrenched in the way we are. The things we want themselves rely on multiple factors we have control of at various levels. The main problem here, is that, most often, our needs and wills are often impermanent—they don't convey an absolute and unbreakable _meaning_. In this sense, "pure will", especially "in every moment" is practically impossible ; at least if considered as a will toward _one_ thing.
In the _Hagakure,_ the main idea is that when one gets to truly accept his inevitable death, one gets this true meaning of freedom, which can allow one to pursue, with _true willingness_ his goals.
