title: Back in it. Introduction

Back in what? Getting into journaling again.

I mean, it's not like I wasn't doing it before, but I was lacking regularity and doing it in the open has different stakes. I like sharing things and the idea that people might read me is a good motivation. It also forces myself to work on making my writings clearer and more accessible. I know I can't talk about random matters because people won't follow. One thing, indeed, is that I've opened this blog so I can write about my travels when I'll finally be leaving.

Until then, you can expect random tidbits from what happens in my mind during schooldays and weekends (both of which are oddly similar in these strange times). For example, it's the first time I'm enjoying spring so much these days. I know it will come with the (temporary?) end of my scholarship and the easing of COVID-19 restrictions, so seeing the shoots expanding their buds into pretty flowers has never been this appreciable. Leaving my bicycle at home and walking to school could play a part in this, but which of the chicken or the egg?

As a foretaste, here is the loosely defined planning of what I hope will be more than just a sabbatical. Since multiple friends are happening to finish in the same time period as me, I'm hoping to convince them into making a bit of the way with me. This is not a _sine qua non_, since it's sometimes complicated to plan things up with them and travelling alone is as much of value. It's still bringing me to my journey's first leg, the far north. Before the middle of June, I'll be leaving my hometown in Switzerland, to go hitchhiking through Germany, trying to reach [Cape Nordkinn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Nordkinn). I'm giving myself the time needed, but I don't expect this leg to take more than two months. I've choosen Cape Nordkinn mostly for the symbolic remotness of it, forging a (mostly imaginary) initiatic trip vibe â€“ the European equivalent to hitchhiking to Alaska?

After this
