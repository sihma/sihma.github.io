title: In Norway
---
I got into Norway maybe a week and a half ago. It's remarkable: the further I travel, the more I forget  about the things happenning to me. I feel like I become sort of insensitive. Especially when hitchhiking, you have to entertain your driver most of the time, and thinking of the last rides I took on the way to Tromsø, I have reached a point where I don't even know what I was talking about with my drivers.

Anyway, it happens that I am now hosted at someone's in the countryside of the Tromsø Kommune and I can use one of their (the guy has a lot) computers to type this and do some administration. I'll try to recap the path that took me here, more for me since if I don't I'll probably forget more than I can actually remember now. 

I believe I left Geneva the 25th ; I was going to a village in the Ain countryside to get a SIM card with a data plan---I shipped it here since the swiss mobile plans are so expensive. Hitchhiking to the village -- around an hour from Geneva. Less than a hundred kilometers -- took me around 4 hours. I wasn't annoyed by that---it was the remoteness of the place that was at fault. At least, it's what I usually tell myself.
