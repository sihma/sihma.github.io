Hey, hey. It's been a while now. A lot of stuff happened but nothing that should have really prevented me from blogging. Anyway, that's all from the mea culpa.

I remember receiving an email from someone who asked when I was going to blog again. Sadly I lost it and I believe I never answered. I guess I'm writing this partly for you.

I came back from Norway something like the end of July last year. If you know me, you know I have a shitty memory. I can't remember the names of people I've spent time with. I can't remember the birthdates of people I love. People forgive this saying that a lot of stuff happens in my life, but maybe I'm just uncaring. Or it's neurologic. Whichever the reason is, I tend to remember only the most random things in a very detailed manner, so when it comes to making a timeline of what happened after I left Norway, — eugh… 

1. Leaving Norway and the people who hosted. Thanks to them again, I had a wonderful time.
2. Hitchhiking down to Europe in five days without a break. Remarkably, I had very little incentive to stop on my way. I wanted to go to the Hitchgathering and this was enough to make me let go of my original goal of going back through Finland, Sweden and maybe even Russia. The latter is sadly less conceivable now because of the current events.

One thing to note about Northern Norway in summer, is that it feels very safe because of the sun shining from 0200 to 0155. Because there is only one road (E6) with a 90 kmh speed limit, you can hitchhike from almost anywhere and there is traffic even during the late hours. All this means that my hitchhiking hours where very much out of the ordinary with my day often starting at 1100 and ending at 0100 in the morning.

Coming back to Southern Norway—there is no Western or Eastern Norway since the country is pretty much one big strip—was a surprise. Why is the sky dark? Starting at Trondheim is the highway again. The part between Trondheim (or Trondhjem as one persone told me—you'd be surprised by the number of dialects in Norway) and Olso was pretty slow the first time and I was a bit scared.
